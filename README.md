## Introduction

Employee Management is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the management of employee data. The project consists of two main components:

- **Front-end (React):** A user-friendly interface for adding, modifying, and viewing employee details. It includes a welcome page for adding new employees and a listing page with filtering capabilities.

- **Back-end (Flask):** A minimalistic server providing basic CRUD functionalities. Employee data is stored and retrieved from a database.

## Features

- Add, modify, view, and delete employee data.
- Welcome page with a form for adding new employees.
- Listing page with filters for employee name and salary.
- Lazy-loading for improved performance.
- Structured and organized codebase for maintainability.
